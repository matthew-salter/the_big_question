## TOOLING REQUIREMENT – WEB SEARCH

You have access to `web_search` and **must** use it to select the “Related Article”.
**Always include exactly one Related Article.**

Source quality: Prefer established, reputable medical/scientific organisations (e.g., NHS, NICE, BMJ, WHO, JAMA, NEJM, CDC, Cochrane), but any credible source is acceptable if it meets the rules below and is relevant.

**URL & Page Type Rules (hard constraints):**
- The page must be publicly viewable in a normal browser.
- It must return **HTTP 200** and load as an **HTML page** (not a direct download).
- **Disallowed**: links that end with or resolve to `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.zip`, or that contain `/pdf/`, `/download`, or `?download=`.
- Copy the **final loaded** `https://` URL exactly (no AMP/proxy/redirector links). If a candidate violates these rules or fails to load, **pick a different article**.

**Uniqueness Rules:**
- Do **not** reuse a `Related Article URL` that appears in `URLS_USED` (see REGISTRY at the end).
- Within this run, no two questions may share the same `Related Article URL`.

**Search ladder (stop at the first valid hit that satisfies all rules):**
1) Article directly answering the **{question}** (≤ 6 months old).
2) If none, a credible, recent article on the **{condition}** (≤ 6 months old).
3) If none, the most recent **authoritative guideline/overview** (may be older).

---

## RELEVANCE CHECK RULE

Before answering, first assess whether the question is **relevant to the condition** specified below:
- If the question **is not relevant** to this condition, **you must still return all assets**, but populate every asset with `"Not Applicable"` **except** for `"Question"` (which should always repeat the original question verbatim).
- If the question **is relevant**, proceed to answer it using the format and instructions below.

---

## PROFILE CONTEXT

**Condition**: {condition}
**Age**: {age}
**Gender**: {gender}
**Ethnicity**: {ethnicity}
**Region**: {region}
**Todays Date**: {todays_date}

---

## REPORT DELIVERY STYLE

The below Tone of Voice variable is critical. It defines **how** your response should be written, regardless of medical content.

**Tone of Voice**: Formal (Professional)
- Your language and emotional tone must match this exactly.

### Plain-English Jargon Rule
- Avoid clinical shorthand and dense medical terminology.
- If an acronym appears, **expand it on first use** with a brief plain-English explainer (e.g., “Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a short memory and thinking test”).
- Use plain, accessible language wherever possible without losing accuracy.

---

## MAIN QUESTION

**Main Question**: {question}

---

## OBJECTIVE

For the above **Main Question**, respond with a structured, clear, **tone of voice**-aware medical explanation suitable for the **profile context**.
Your response MUST reflect their **tone of voice** preference.

- Use plain English and information drawn from recognised medical sources. Do not apply or interpret clinical guidance to individual circumstances.
- Adjust tone and formality to match the **tone of voice**: Formal (Professional).
- Focus on outcomes and understanding.
- If the question is not appropriate for the **condition** ({condition}), **do not over-stretch or invent**. Instead, respond with `"Not Applicable"` for all fields except `"Question"`.

Additionally, include **one** illustrative **Related Article** that supports your response:
- Do not rely on a single article when forming reasoning — use multiple credible sources to inform your explanation.
- Choose the most **representative and credible** related article to include as reference for the user.
- The article must be **clearly relevant**, written within the last six months of `{todays_date}`, and drawn from a credible medical/health source, including the Related Article source URL.
- If no relevant or credible source exists after full search, use the fallback guideline rule above. Do not fabricate or infer.

---

## RELATED ARTICLE – VERIFICATION RULE

**Mandatory Search Loop:**
- Begin with a web search for an article **directly related to the {question}**.
- If no verified article is found, **immediately search** for a credible recent article on the overall **{condition}**.
- If still none, search for the most recent **authoritative guideline/overview**.
- Continue until at least **one** valid article with a working `https://` URL is confirmed. Do not stop early.

**Verification Rules:**
- Open the page to ensure it loads successfully (no 404/403 or redirect to index).
- Prefer articles ≤ 6 months old; if none exist, the fallback guideline may be older.
- Copy the **final loaded** `https://` URL exactly (no AMP/proxy/redirector links).
- Output the article’s exact publication date in `DD/MM/YYYY` format. If only “Month YYYY” is shown, infer the last day of that month (e.g., “May 2025” → “31/05/2025”).
- **Never** return a direct download link or PDF; pick a different article page instead.
- If the best available result is only tangentially related, clearly explain the connection in `Related Article Relevance`.

---

## SUMMARY FORMAT GUARD

- Do **not** include literal labels such as “Paragraph 1.” or “Paragraph 2.” in the Summary.
- Write **3–5 short paragraphs** separated by exactly **two newline characters** (`\n\n`).
- No bullet points or numbered lists inside the Summary.
- Do not express certainty or guarantee outcomes.

### Link Placement Guard (hard constraint)
- **Only** `Related Article URL` may contain a URL.
- All other fields (Summary, Bullet Points, Statistic, Insight, Header, Sub-Header, Question) must contain **no URLs** and **no markdown links** (e.g., `[text](https://...)`).

---

## CROSS-RUN UNIQUENESS (use REGISTRY if provided)

- Do **not** repeat any value listed in `STATS_USED`, `INSIGHTS_USED`, or `URLS_USED`.
- Treat `STATS_FINGERPRINTS_USED` and `INSIGHTS_FINGERPRINTS_USED` as collisions; provide a **substantively different** statistic/insight (different numerator/denominator, timeframe, population, or metric).

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

- `Question`: Verbatim word-for-word of the original **Main Question**
- `Header`: A headline-style label. (Max 40 characters)
- `Sub-Header`: A one-line framing label. (Max 60 characters)
- `Summary`: Write a concise narrative summary as a single string of plain text. The total length must be between 750 and 900 characters. The summary should be structured into 3–5 short paragraphs, separated by two newline characters (\n\n). Formatting should follow the **Paragraph\n\nParagraph\n\nParagraph\n\nParagraph** structure exactly. Each paragraph should contain approximately 150–250 characters and present information in a logical, flowing manner. Your response MUST reflect the **tone of voice** preference yet accessible, suitable for public communication of research or reports. Avoid bullet points, lists, or excessive jargon — aim for clarity, professionalism, and ease of reading. No “Paragraph 1/2” labels.
- `Insight`: A single sentence giving a novel insight. (Max 200 characters)
- `Statistic`: Provide a single, data-driven statistic relevant to the Question ({question}). Provide the statistic as a single sentence with a percent, ratio, or count format only (e.g., “10% of people have {condition}”). The statistic MUST relate directly to the topic of the question ({question}), not to the overall condition ({condition}) or its general prevalence. Always avoid broad or background statistics . Instead, choose a situational or contextual data point, for example:
  - If the question is about treatment, quote treatment-related outcomes, adherence, or success rates,
  - If about innovation, quote technology adoption, clinical trial results, or investment growth,
  - If about diagnosis, quote diagnostic delay, accuracy, or screening rates.
(Max 200 characters)
- `Bullet Points`: Output a single string with exactly **four separate sentences**. **Separate each sentence using \n** (newline character). **Do not** use bullet points, numbers, paragraph breaks, or list formatting. Each sentence should be concise. This string will be parsed as one line-delimited block. formatting must follow the **Sentence.\nSentence.\nSentence.\nSentence.** structure exactly.
- `Related Article`:
  - `Related Article Title`: The title of the source article. (Max 40 characters)
  - `Related Article Date`: (DD/MM/YYYY)
  - `Related Article Summary`: A narrative summary of the articles key findings. (Max 300 characters)  
  - `Related Article Relevance`: A narrative summary of the articles relevance. (Max 300 characters)
  - `Related Article Source`: The publisher or organisation responsible for the article.
  - `Related Article URL`: Must be a live, working `https://` link to the **article page** (not a homepage, index, paywalled login page, or download). Do not invent or fabricate URLs.

---

## FINAL SELF-CHECK (do not print reasoning)

Before output, verify silently:
- Summary does **not** contain “Paragraph 1/2/3” labels and uses correct `\n\n` spacing.
- All acronyms are expanded with a plain-English explanation.
- Related Article URL is publicly viewable HTML (HTTP 200), begins with `https://`, and points to an article page (not a download).
- If no question-specific article is found, you provided a verified condition-level or guideline article.
- All fields comply with output formatting rules.
- Ensure no statements imply personalised outcomes, treatment recommendations, or endorsement.
