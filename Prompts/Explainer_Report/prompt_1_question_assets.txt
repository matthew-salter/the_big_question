## TOOLING REQUIREMENT – WEB SEARCH

You have access to `web_search` and **must** use it to select the “Related Article”.
**Always include exactly one Related Article.**

Source quality: Prefer established, reputable medical/scientific organisations (e.g., NHS, NICE, BMJ, WHO, JAMA, NEJM, CDC, Cochrane), but any credible source is acceptable if it meets the rules below and is relevant.

**URL & Page Type Rules (hard constraints):**
- The page must be publicly viewable in a normal browser.
- It must return **HTTP 200** and load as an **HTML page** (not a direct download).
- **Disallowed**: links that end with or resolve to `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.zip`, or that contain `/pdf/`, `/download`, or `?download=`.
- Copy the **final loaded** `https://` URL exactly (no AMP/proxy/redirector links). If a candidate violates these rules or fails to load, **pick a different article**.

**Uniqueness Rules:**
- Do **not** reuse a `Related Article URL` that appears in `URLS_USED` (see REGISTRY at the end).
- Within this run, no two questions may share the same `Related Article URL`.

**Search ladder (stop at the first valid hit that satisfies all rules):**
1) Article directly answering the **{question}** (≤ 6 months old).
2) If none, a credible, recent article on the **{condition}** (≤ 6 months old).
3) If none, the most recent **authoritative guideline/overview** (may be older).

---

## RELEVANCE CHECK RULE

Before answering, first assess whether the question is **relevant to the condition** specified below:
- If the question **is not relevant** to this condition, **you must still return all assets**, but populate every asset with `"Not Applicable"` **except** for `"Question"` (which should always repeat the original question verbatim).
- If the question **is relevant**, proceed to answer it using the format and instructions below.

---

## PROFILE CONTEXT

**Condition**: {condition}
**Age**: {age}
**Gender**: {gender}
**Ethnicity**: {ethnicity}
**Region**: {region}
**Todays Date**: {todays_date}

---

## REPORT DELIVERY STYLE

The below Tone of Voice variable is critical. It defines **how** your response should be written, regardless of medical content.

**Tone of Voice**: Formal (Professional)
- Your language and emotional tone must match this exactly.

### Plain-English Jargon Rule
- Avoid clinical shorthand and dense medical terminology.
- If an acronym appears, **expand it on first use** with a brief plain-English explainer (e.g., “Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a short memory and thinking test”).
- Use plain, accessible language wherever possible without losing accuracy.

---

## MAIN QUESTION

**Main Question**: {question}

---

## OBJECTIVE

For the above **Main Question**, respond with a structured, clear, **tone of voice**-aware medical explanation suitable for the **profile context**.
Your response MUST reflect their **tone of voice** preference.

- Use plain English and information drawn from recognised medical sources. Do not apply or interpret clinical guidance to individual circumstances.
- Adjust tone and formality to match the **tone of voice**: Formal (Professional).
- Focus on outcomes and understanding.
- If the question is not appropriate for the **condition** ({condition}), **do not over-stretch or invent**. Instead, respond with `"Not Applicable"` for all fields except `"Question"`.

Additionally, include **one** illustrative **Related Article** that supports your response:
- Do not rely on a single article when forming reasoning — use multiple credible sources to inform your explanation.
- Choose the most **representative and credible** related article to include as reference for the user.
- The article must be **clearly relevant**, written within the last six months of `{todays_date}`, and drawn from a credible medical/health source, including the Related Article source URL.
- If no relevant or credible source exists after full search, use the fallback guideline rule above. Do not fabricate or infer.

---

## RELATED ARTICLE – VERIFICATION RULE

**Mandatory Search Loop:**
- Begin with a web search for an article **directly related to the {question}**.
- If no verified article is found, **immediately search** for a credible recent article on the overall **{condition}**.
- If still none, search for the most recent **authoritative guideline/overview**.
- Continue until at least **one** valid article with a working `https://` URL is confirmed. Do not stop early.

**Verification Rules:**
- Open the page to ensure it loads successfully (no 404/403 or redirect to index).
- Prefer articles ≤ 6 months old; if none exist, the fallback guideline may be older.
- Copy the **final loaded** `https://` URL exactly (no AMP/proxy/redirector links).
- Output the article’s exact publication date in `DD/MM/YYYY` format. If only “Month YYYY” is shown, infer the last day of that month (e.g., “May 2025” → “31/05/2025”).
- **Never** return a direct download link or PDF; pick a different article page instead.
- If the best available result is only tangentially related, clearly explain the connection in `Related Article Relevance`.

---

## SUMMARY FORMAT GUARD

- Do **not** include literal labels such as “Paragraph 1.” or “Paragraph 2.” in the Summary.
- The summary **must** be written as **3–5 short paragraphs**, separated by exactly **two newline characters** (`\n\n`) inside the JSON string.
- Aim for **750–900 characters** total (this is a guideline, not a hard limit). It may go longer if necessary for clarity.
- Ensure each paragraph is a complete thought and ends with a period.
- The literal `\n\n` must appear between paragraphs, not replaced by spaces or single newlines.
- No bullet points or numbered lists inside the Summary.
- Do not express certainty or guarantee outcomes.

### Link Placement Guard (hard constraint)
- **Only** `Related Article URL` may contain a URL.
- All other fields (Summary, Bullet Points, Statistic, Insight, Header, Sub-Header, Question) must contain **no URLs** and **no markdown links** (e.g., `[text](https://...)`).

---

## CROSS-RUN UNIQUENESS (use REGISTRY if provided)

- Do **not** repeat any value listed in `STATS_USED`, `INSIGHTS_USED`, or `URLS_USED`.
- Treat `STATS_FINGERPRINTS_USED` and `INSIGHTS_FINGERPRINTS_USED` as collisions; provide a **substantively different** statistic/insight (different numerator/denominator, timeframe, population, or metric).

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

- `Question`: Verbatim word-for-word of the original **Main Question**
- `Header`: A headline-style label. (Max 40 characters)
- `Sub-Header`: A one-line framing label. (Max 60 characters)

- `Insight`: A single sentence giving a novel insight. (Max 200 characters)
- `Statistic`: Provide a single, data-driven statistic relevant to the Question ({question}). One sentence only, using a percent, ratio, or count. Must relate to the **question topic**, not general prevalence. (Max 200 characters)
- `Bullet Points`: Output a single string with exactly **four separate sentences**. **Separate each sentence using `\n`** (newline). No bullets, numbers, or extra breaks. Format exactly: `Sentence.\nSentence.\nSentence.\nSentence.`
- `Related Article`:
  - `Related Article Title`: (Max 40 characters)
  - `Related Article Date`: (DD/MM/YYYY)
  - `Related Article Summary`: (Max 300 characters)
  - `Related Article Relevance`: (Max 300 characters)
  - `Related Article Source`: Publisher/organisation

**Do not include any keys other than those listed above.** Do not include `_meta`, debug notes, or auxiliary fields.

---

## FINAL SELF-CHECK (do not print reasoning)

Before output, verify silently:
- Summary has **3–5 paragraphs**, separated by `\n\n` (escaped newlines) inside the JSON string.
- All acronyms are expanded on first use.
- Related Article URL is publicly viewable HTML (HTTP 200), begins with `https://`, and points to an article page (not a download).
- If no question-specific article is found, you provided a verified condition-level or guideline article.
- All fields comply with output formatting rules and **no extra keys** are present.
- Ensure no statements imply personalised outcomes, treatment recommendations, or endorsement.
