You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to create a structured, data-driven report in response to a key client question.  
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to identify the primary influencing factors and their projected effects.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{client}

**CLIENT CONTEXT**  
{client_context}

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{main_question}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**  
{question_context}

### OBJECTIVE  
You must:  
- Identify exactly {number_sections} **sections** (no fewer) influencing {target_variable} of {commodity} in the {region} over the next {time_range}.  
  - Assign each section a percentage **makeup** toward the overall **change** (total = 100%).  
  - Use multiple sources (where available) stiictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (no later) to determine the makeup. Do not rely on a single article.  
  - Choose the most relevant or representative article to include as the illustrative source.

- For each section, identify exactly {number_sub_sections} **sub-sections** (no fewer) that influence it:  
  - Assign each a percentage **makeup** contribution within its parent section (sum = 100% within section).  
  - Base all predictions and percentages on aggregated reasoning from multiple sources (where available) published within the last {reference_age_range} (no later).  
  - Then select one supporting reference article per sub-section.

- For each sub-section:  
  - Estimate the expected percentage **change** over the defined time range.  
  - If pressure is **negative** on {target_variable}, the **change** must be expressed as a **neagtive percentage range** (e.g. `-4.25%`).  
  - If pressure is **positive** on {target_variable}, the **change** must be expressed as a **positive percentage range** (e.g. `+2.00%`).  
  - **Do not flip or interpret the sign based on language or assumptions — follow the defined logic exactly.**
  - Calculate the corresponding **effect range** using this formula: `Effect = Makeup × Change`
  - Round all Makeup values to **0 decimal places**  
  - Round all section Change & Effect values to **1 decimal place**  

- For each section:  
  - Sum all sub-section effects to calculate `Section Change`. 
  - Multiply each by `Section Makeup` to calculate `Section Effect`.  
  - **Do not reinterpret the direction, magnitude, or sign of these values. Always follow the exact calculations defined above.**
  - Round all Makeup values to **0 decimal places**  
  - Round all section Change & Effect values to **2 decimal places**  

- Finally, calculate the report-wide projection range: `Report Change` = Sum of all Section Effect 
  - **Do not round individual components before summing. Use post-sum rounding only.**

  - Include:
    - `Title` 
    - `Date` 
    - `Summary` 
    - `Relevance`
