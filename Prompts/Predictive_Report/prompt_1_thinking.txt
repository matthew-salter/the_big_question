You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.
If your output exceeds token limits, return a complete truncated section-by-section output and continue automatically in the next response using the same structure.
Disable all inline citations, footnotes, and content references. Do not use ::contentReference or oaicite.
If output is too long, continue in next response automatically with no repetition or commentary.
Resume where you left off. Continue output in valid JSON only.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to create a structured, data-driven report in response to a key client question.  
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to identify the primary influencing factors and their projected effects.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{client}

**CLIENT CONTEXT**  
{client_context}

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{main_question}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**

### OBJECTIVE  
You must:  
- Identify the {number_sections} most significant **sections** influencing {target_variable} of {commodity} in the {region} over the next {time_range}.  
  - Assign each section a percentage **makeup** toward the overall **change** (total = 100%).  
  - Use multiple sources (where available) to determine the makeup. Do not rely on a single article.  
  - Choose the most relevant or representative article to include as the illustrative source.

- For each section, identify {number_sub_sections} **sub-sections** that influence it:  
  - Assign each a percentage **makeup** contribution within its parent section (sum = 100% within section).  
  - Base all predictions and percentages on aggregated reasoning from multiple sources (where available).  
  - Then select one supporting reference article per sub-section.

- For each sub-section:  
  - Estimate the **low and high bounds** for the expected percentage **change** over the defined time range.  
  - If pressure is **negative** (e.g. rising cost, falling supply), the **change** must be expressed as a **positive percentage range** (e.g. `+4.25% to +6.80%`).  
  - If pressure is **positive** (e.g. falling cost, rising supply), the **change** must be expressed as a **negative percentage range** (e.g. `-2.00% to -4.15%`).  
  - **Do not flip or interpret the sign based on language or assumptions — follow the defined logic exactly.**
  - Calculate the corresponding **effect range** using this formula:  
    - `Effect Low = Makeup × Change Low`  
    - `Effect High = Makeup × Change High`  
  - Round all sub-section values to **2 decimal places**.

- For each section:  
  - Sum all sub-section effects to calculate `Section Change Low` and `Section Change High`  
  - Multiply each by `Section Makeup` to calculate `Section Effect Low` and `Section Effect High`  
  - Round all section values to **1 decimal place**  
  - **Do not reinterpret the direction, magnitude, or sign of these values. Always follow the exact calculations defined above.**

- Finally, calculate the report-wide projection range:  
  - `Report Change Low` = Sum of all Section Effect Lows  
  - `Report Change High` = Sum of all Section Effect Highs  
  - **Do not round individual components before summing. Use post-sum rounding only.**
