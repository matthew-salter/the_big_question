You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to create a structured, data-driven report in response to a key client question.  
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to identify the primary influencing factors and their projected effects.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{client}

**CLIENT CONTEXT**

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{main_question}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**

### OBJECTIVE  
You must:
**[1] Top-Level Section Identification**:
- Identify exactly {number_sections} distinct sections (no fewer) influencing {target_variable} of {commodity} in {region} over the next {time_range}.
- Each section must include:
  - A Section Title
  - A Section Makeup (% contribution to the overall change) — must sum to exactly 100% across all sections, using integer values only.
  - A Section Change (%) — calculated strictly as the sum total of all Sub-Section Effects within that section.
  - A Section Effect (%) — calculated as: Section Effect = Section Change × Section Makeup  
    - All values must respect signs and decimal rules:
      - Section Makeup: integers only, must sum to 100
      - Section Change/Effect: float with 1 decimal place only

**[2] Sub-Sections per Section**:
- Within each section, identify exactly {number_sub_sections} sub-sections (no fewer) that influence it.
- Each sub-section must include:
  - A Sub-Section Title
  - A Sub-Section Makeup (%) — must sum to exactly 100% per section, using integer values only.
  - A Sub-Section Change (%) — strictly directional, one decimal place:
    - Negative if downward pressure
    - Positive if upward pressure
    - Do not invert the sign or reinterpret the direction
  - A Sub-Section Effect (%) — calculated as: Sub-Section Effect = Sub-Section Change × Sub-Section Makeup  
    - Must be a float with 1 decimal place only

**[3] Section-Level Maths Enforcement**:
- You must calculate:
  - Section Change = Sum of all Sub-Section Effects (within section)
  - Section Effect = Section Change × Section Makeup
- You may NOT:
  - Use averages or weighted means to determine Section Change
  - Derive Section Change from Sub-Section Changes — always derive from Sub-Section Effects
  - Reverse signs based on interpretation
  - Round intermediate values prior to final calculation (round only final outputs)
  - Skip any decimal or sign conventions

**[4] Sources**:
- For each Section and Sub-Section, select multiple supporting articles, where available.
- Select and name one most relevant article per Section and per Sub-Section, all published strictly within the last {reference_age_range}, no later than {today_date}.
- Articles must not be older than allowed under {reference_age_range}

---

### RULES: 
- Today's date is {today_date}.
- All reference sourcing related articles:
  - Be strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later) of {today_date}.
  - Be credible and relevant
  - Support reasoning (not dictate percentages)
  - Include:
    - `Title` 
    - `Date` 
    - `Summary` 
    - `Relevance` 
    - `Source` (no URLs)  
- If no source exists, use `"Unknown"`
