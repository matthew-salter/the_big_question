You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to create a structured, data-driven report in response to a key client question.  
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to identify the primary influencing factors and their projected effects.

### OBJECTIVE  
You must:  
- Identify exactly {number_sections} **sections** (no fewer) influencing {target_variable} of {commodity} in the {region} over the next {time_range}.  
  - Assign each section a percentage **makeup** toward the overall **change** (strictly sum total = 100%).  
  - Use multiple related article sources (where available) strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later) of todays date {today_date} to determine the makeup. Do not rely on a single related article.  
  - Choose the most relevant or representative related article, strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later), to include as the illustrative source.

- For each section, identify exactly {number_sub_sections} **sub-sections** (no fewer) that influence it:  
  - Assign each a percentage **makeup** contribution within its parent section (strictly sum total = 100% within section).  
  - Base all predictions and percentages on aggregated reasoning from multiple sources (where available) strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later) of todays date {today_date} .  
  - Choose the most relevant or representative related article, strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later) of todays date {today_date}, to include as the illustrative source.

- For each sub-section:  
  - Estimate the expected percentage **Sub-Section Change** over the defined time range.  
  - If pressure is **negative** on {target_variable}, the **Sub-Section Change** must be expressed as a **negative percentage range** (e.g. `-4.2%`).  
  - If pressure is **positive** on {target_variable}, the **Sub-Section Change** must be expressed as a **positive percentage range** (e.g. `+2.0%`).  
  - **Do not flip or interpret the sign based on language or assumptions — follow the defined logic exactly.**
  - Calculate the corresponding **Sub-Section Effect** using this formula: `Sub-Section Effect = Sub-Section Change × Sub-Section Makeup`
  - All **Sub-Section Makeup** values must strictly be to **0 decimal places**  
  - All **Sub-Section Change** & **Sub-Section Effect** values must strictly be to **1 decimal place** 

- For each section:  
  - Sum total all the child **Sub-Section Effects** values to calculate the **Section Change**.
  - Calculate the corresponding **Section Effect** using this formula: `Section Effect = Section Change × Section Makeup`
  - **Do not reinterpret the direction, magnitude, or sign of these values. Always follow the exact calculations defined above.**
  - All **Section Makeup** values must strictly be to **0 decimal places**  
  - All **Section Change** & **Section Effect** values must strictly be to **1 decimal place**

### RULES: 
- Today's date is {today_date}.
- All reference sourcing related articles:
  - Be strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later) of {today_date}.
  - Be credible and relevant
  - Support reasoning (not dictate percentages)
  - Include:
    - `Title` 
    - `Date` 
    - `Summary` 
    - `Relevance` 
    - `Source` (no URLs)  
- If no source exists, use `"Unknown"`
