You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to generate structured table data based on structured data previously identified.
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to help generate the table data.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{client}

**CLIENT CONTEXT**  
{client_context}

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{main_question}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**  
{question_context}

**SECTION STRUCTURE**  
The following JSON structure contains all the sections and sub-sections structure:    
{prompt_1_thinking}

### OBJECTIVE
You must:
- Use the provided *section structure* to generate structured table data sets.

- For the overall report *change*, extract the **report change** values.
- List in table format; 
  - The title in the first column. (e.g. {target_variable} of {commodity} in the {region} over the next {time_range}.) - (Please ensure to change to Title-case however, also ensure 'small words'; "in", "on", "the", "if", etc. remain lower case.) 
  - The **report change low** in the second column (e.g. +8.0)

- For the overall report table extract the **section title**, **makeup**, **change** and **effect** values for each of the sections.
- List in table format; 
  - Each of the **section title** in the first column.
  - Each of the corresponding **makeup** values in the second column. (e.g. 40%)
  - Each of the corresponding **change** value in the third column. (e.g. +2.5%)
  - Each of the corresponding **effect high** value in the fourth column. (e.g. +1.0%)
- Sort order the table;
  - The **section title** with the highest **makeup** fists, followed by the highest **change** value value second, followed by the highest **effect** value third.

- For each section table extract the **sub-section title**, **makeup**, **change** and **effect** values for each of the sub-sections.
- List in table format; 
  - Each of the **sub-section title** in the first column.
  - Each of the corresponding **makeup** values in the second column. (e.g. 60%)
  - Each of the corresponding **change value** in the third column. (e.g. +3.55%)
  - Each of the corresponding **effect** value in the fourth column. (e.g. +2.13%)
- Sort order the table;
  - The **sub-section title** with the highest **makeup** fists, followed by the highest **change** value value second, followed by the highest **effect** value third.
