### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to compile and restructure the a final report output based on structured data previously identified.
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to help generate the report structure.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{{client}}

**CLIENT CONTEXT**  
{{client_context}}

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{{main_question}}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**  
{{question_context}}

**SECTION STRUCTURE**  
The following JSON structure contains all the sections and sub-sections structure:    
{{prompt_2_output}}

**SECTION ASSETS**  
The following JSON structure contains all the sections and sub-sections assets:  
{{prompt_3_output}}

**REPORT ASSETS**  
The following JSON structure contains all the report-wide assets:  
{{prompt_4_output}}

**REPORT TABLES**  
The following JSON structure contains all the report-wide tables:  
{{prompt_5_output}}

### OBJECTIVE
You must:
- Take all the structured JSON inputs from the *section structure*, *section assets*, *report assets* and *report tables*
- Unpack and extract every asset from each of the JSON snippets
- Ensure every single asset is 'unpacked' from the JSON snippets word for word and ensure none are missing.
- Restructure all 'unpacked' assets into a final layout order:
  - Intro Assets (static)
  - Section Assets (dynamic by section)
  - Sub-Section Assets (dynamic by sub-section)
  - Outro Assets (static)
- Maintain exact labelling and formatting structure.
- Ensure all sub-sections are nested correctly with their parent section.
- Do not duplicate or omit any fields. Use the original language provided in each asset.

---

### RULES
- Do not invent new sections, sub-sections, data points, or metrics.
- Only use supplied data and context.
- Do not remove, omit or relabel any assets.
- Maintain the original formatting of all paragraph and bullet-based fields.
- The number of sections and sub-sections is dynamic, ensure this is preserved.
- Ensure all sub-section assets are grouped beneath the correct parent section.
