## INSTRUCTIONS

You are helping to write a single image prompt to generate an AI image for a visual health report.  
Use your understanding of the **patient context**, the **character attributes** (avatar definition), and the attached **question assets** to produce an image generation prompt.

## QUESTION ASSETS

{question_assets}

## PATIENT CONTEXT

**Condition**: {condition}  
**Age**: {age}  
**Gender**: {gender}  
**Ethnicity**: {ethnicity}  
**Region**: {region}  
**Todays Date**: {todays_date}

## CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES (Avatar for continuity)

Use the following avatar attributes verbatim to ensure consistent depiction across all images.  
Do **not** contradict or invent new attributes; you may selectively reference or imply them to keep the prompt concise.  

{character_attributes}

## REPORT DELIVERY STYLE

These two variables are critical. They define **how** your image prompts should be written, regardless of medical content.

**Tone of Voice**: Formal (Professional)  
    - Your language and emotional tone must match this exactly.  

**Report Use Case**: Personal Education  
    - Structure your prompts to serve this purpose explicitly.

## OBJECTIVE

Generate an image prompt for the given question that seamlessly integrates all three input sources:

1. **Patient Context**  
   - Accurately reflect the condition ({condition}) in the visual scene with subtle, respectful cues.  
   - Present the patient in a flattering and approachable way.  
   - Ensure the setting/environment is culturally and geographically consistent with the region (e.g., a UK home, clinic, or park).  

2. **Character Attributes (Avatar Continuity)**  
   - Depict the patient avatar drawing directly from the provided **Character Attributes**.  
   - Honor appearance details such as hair, clothing, posture, grooming, and expression.  
   - Preserve the character’s attributes while presenting the patient in a flattering and approachable way (uplifting, confident posture and approachable demeanor).  

3. **Question Section Assets**  
   - Ground the image in the educational purpose of the **Question**.  
   - Emphasize the context of the specific question (e.g., diagnosis, treatment, lifestyle) through environment, props, or subtle cues.  
   - Draw inspiration from the Summary, Bullet Points, Statistic, Insight, or Recommendation fields, translating them into visual elements when appropriate.  
   - Never depict text from the assets literally inside the image; instead, visualise their meaning (e.g., showing a doctor’s office to imply “diagnosis” rather than writing “diagnosis” on screen).  

4. **Overall Presentation**  
   - The image should be visually clear, relatable, and reassuring.  
   - Convey professionalism (formal tone) and education (supportive, non-stigmatising).  
   - Avoid distressing, clinical, or overly dramatic portrayals of conditions.  
   - Always maintain cultural fidelity, uplifting tone, and continuity across all generated images.  

## IMAGE PROMPT RULES

- Begin the prompt with EXACTLY:  
  "A realistic photograph. The image is taken in focus with a natural depth of field. The image appears as if taken with a professional camera. No text is present in the image."
- Depict the avatar simply as “an older adult male/female” or equivalent basic phrasing.  
- Describe only the **scene, setting, lighting, posture, and mood** in the main narrative section.  
- Do **not** include the condition or detailed character attributes in this section.  
- After the main scene description, append a separate block that begins with **"Character attributes:"**, followed by the full verbatim list of:  
  - Condition  
  - All attributes from **character attributes** 
- Avoid logos, watermarks, or on-image text. Avoid brand names and identifiable private locations.  
- Keep language precise and visual.  

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

- `Question`: Verbatim word-for-word of the original **Main Question** from the attached question assets.  
- `Image_Prompt`: A single string containing:  
  1. The lead-in sentence and scene description (2–6 sentences).  
  2. A newline, then the block of Character Attributes exactly as specified above.  

## IMPORTANT - STRICT JSON-ONLY FORMAT  
**DO NOT** add any explanations, summaries, visualisations, or tables.  
**DO NOT** return any text before or after the JSON output.  
**ONLY** return JSON in the exact format below.
