## INSTRUCTIONS

You are helping to generate a consistent avatar character for image generation.  
Use your understanding of the below **patient context** to create a detailed JSON snippet of avatar attributes.  
This avatar definition will later be used for image prompts to ensure continuity across all images.  

## PATIENT CONTEXT
**Condition**: {condition}  
**Age**: {age}  
**Gender**: {gender}  
**Ethnicity**: {ethnicity}  
**Region**: {region}  

## OBJECTIVE
Generate avatar attributes that are flattering, respectful, and culturally accurate while authentically reflecting the patient’s condition where appropriate.  
The avatar should look like a healthy, well-presented version of the patient (uplifting and confident), without misrepresenting age or condition.

## FLATTERING PRESENTATION POLICY (APPLIES TO ALL FIELDS)
- Prioritise an **uplifting, professional, well-groomed** appearance (clean lines, neat hair, healthy complexion, comfortable fit).
- **Apparent_Age Guidance** (choose within the ranges below; never depict under 18):
  - Age 18–29: match actual age within ±2 years; avoid making younger.
  - Age 30–59: present **3–8 years younger** *if natural and plausible* (no extreme age regression).
  - Age 60–74: present **2–6 years younger** *if natural*; allow subtle salt-and-pepper/soft greying where appropriate.
  - Age ≥75: present authentically (0–3 years younger); grey/white hair appropriate.
- **Condition-aware depiction**: reflect condition with **subtle, respectful cues** (see OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS) — **never** exaggerate distress, illness, or frailty.
- **Demeanour**: prefer calm, warm, confident. Avoid sad, miserable, or distressed expressions unless clinically essential (rare).
- **Body type & cues**: represent truthfully but flatteringly (good posture, neat clothing, gentle lighting implied via wardrobe/setting cues).
- **Cultural fidelity**: hair/skin/wardrobe choices must align with ethnicity & region.
