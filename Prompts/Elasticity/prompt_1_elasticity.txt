### OBJECTIVE  
Please read and evaluate the supply and demand reports.
Your primary objective is to achieve the defined objective. Use the supply and demand reports as **strong** reference materials — they should significantly inform your reasoning.
Based on these supply & demand reports for {commodity}, and based on the supply forecast percentage of {supply_change}, and based on the demand forecast percentage of {demand_change}, you are to identify the supply elasticity (Es) and demand elasticity (Ed):

**Definitions**:
- Supply% Change: Percentage change in supply {supply_change}
- Demand% Change: Percentage change in demand {demand_change}
- Supply Elasticity (Es): Sensitivity of quantity supplied to price changes.
- Demand Elasticity (Ed): Sensitivity of quantity demanded to price changes.

**Elasticity Estimation Guidance**:
- Instruction:
    - Identify the elasticity of supply (Es) and demand (Ed) for the commodity {commodity} and time period {time_range} provided.
    - Do NOT rely on sector-wide averages. Instead, use economic reasoning to infer elasticity based on the characteristics.

- Objective:
    - Elasticity values must be appropriate for the unique behaviour of this commodity over the chosen time horizon.
    - Justify Es and Ed based on realistic production and consumption flexibility, not generic assumptions.

- Cross-Sector Factors to Consider:
    - Time flexibility of supply: how easily can producers scale up/down in this timeframe?
    - Input availability: are raw materials or components scarce or abundant?
    - Inventory/storability: can this good be stored or stockpiled?
    - Substitutability: are alternative products or services readily available to consumers?
    - Technological constraints: how complex is production scaling or innovation?
    - Demand urgency: is this a critical good (inelastic) or discretionary (elastic)?
    - Market structure: does the market behave competitively, monopolistically, or is it regulated?
    - Global vs. local supply chain dependencies

  - Elasticity and Time Horizon:
    - In general, supply and demand elasticity increase with time — more time allows for more adjustment.
    - Short-term: capacity and consumption tend to be rigid (low elasticity)
    - Medium- and long-term: more adaptation possible (higher elasticity)

  - Example Elasticities (for reference only, not templates):
    - Wheat (short-term): Es ~0.2, Ed ~-0.3 (rigid cycles, essential good)
    - Lithium (medium-term): Es ~0.6, Ed ~-0.5 (limited supply ramp, growing tech demand)
    - Smart TVs (long-term): Es ~1.1, Ed ~-1.3 (scalable production, high substitutability)
    - Electricity (short-term): Es ~0.1, Ed ~-0.2 (critical infrastructure, fixed short-term capacity)
    - Solar panels (long-term): Es ~1.3, Ed ~-1.5 (tech innovation, strong demand curve)
    - Luxury handbags (medium-term): Es ~0.9, Ed ~-1.8 (designer supply limits, elastic demand)
    - Construction steel (short-term): Es ~0.4, Ed ~-0.4 (input-constrained supply, essential B2B demand)

- Output Requirement:
    - Return estimated values for:
        - Supply Elasticity (Es)
        - Demand Elasticity (Ed)
    - Justify your elasticity selection using the reasoning above. Do not use placeholder or sector-default values.
