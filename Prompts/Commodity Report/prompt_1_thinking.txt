### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT  
You are helping to prepare a structured, data-driven report by completing an internal strategic thinking phase first.  
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question context to **think deeply**, identify key influencing factors, and build the full logical structure needed to later write the report.

You are **NOT** writing the report or producing final report assets yet — this stage is only for analysis, structuring, and internal calculations.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{{client}}

{{client_context}}

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{{main_question}}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**  
{{question_context}}

### OBJECTIVE  
You must:  
- Identify the {{number_sections}} most significant **sections** influencing {{target_variable}} of {{commodity}} in the {{region}} over the next {{time_range}}.  
  - Assign each section a percentage **makeup** toward the overall **change** (total = 100%).  
  - Use multiple sources (where available) to determine the makeup. Do not rely on a single article.

- For each section, identify {{number_sub_sections}} **sub-sections** that influence it:  
  - Assign each a percentage **makeup** contribution within its parent section (sum = 100% within section).  
  - Base predictions and percentages on aggregated reasoning from multiple sources (where available).

- For each sub-section:  
  - Estimate the **low and high bounds** for the expected percentage **change** over the defined time range.  
  - If pressure is **negative** (e.g. rising cost, falling supply), the **change** must be expressed as a **positive percentage range** (e.g. `+4.25% to +6.80%`).  
  - If pressure is **positive** (e.g. falling cost, rising supply), the **change** must be expressed as a **negative percentage range** (e.g. `-2.00% to -4.15%`).  
  - **Do not flip or reinterpret the sign based on assumptions — strictly follow this rule.**
  - Calculate the corresponding **effect range** using this formula:  
    - `Effect Low = Makeup × Change Low`  
    - `Effect High = Makeup × Change High`
  - Round sub-section values to **2 decimal places**.

- For each section:  
  - Sum all sub-section effects to calculate `Section Change Low` and `Section Change High`.  
  - Multiply by `Section Makeup` to calculate `Section Effect Low` and `Section Effect High`.  
  - Round section values to **1 decimal place**.
  - **Do not flip or reinterpret the sign based on assumptions — strictly follow this rule.**

- Finally, calculate the report-wide projection range:  
  - `Report Change Low` = Sum of all Section Effect Lows  
  - `Report Change High` = Sum of all Section Effect Highs  
  - **Use post-sum rounding only. Do not round components before summing.**

### RULES
- You are not producing final output yet — only internal structured thinking.  
- Apply rigorous reasoning, use multi-source evaluation, and do not bias your analysis toward any single document or event.
- Be self-critical — if sources conflict, use reasoned judgment to pick the stronger or broader-supported perspective.
- Do not select or assign final reference articles yet — reference source selection will occur in later stages (after thinking is complete).
- Ensure all sections, sub-sections, makeups, changes, and effects are internally consistent and mathematically correct.
- You must still ensure each Section and Sub-Section is meaningfully titled and thematically coherent.
- Maintain strict adherence to objective definitions: **do not invert or reinterpret** positive/negative pressure logic.

---

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Be meticulous with calculations.
- Fully populate all {{number_sections}} sections and {{number_sub_sections}} sub-sections.
- If uncertainty exists around any factor, make the best reasoned judgment possible — do not leave blanks.
- This stage is only the **thinking and structuring** phase.

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Output only the structured JSON below.
- No commentary, no report writing, no analysis text outside the JSON.
- This output will feed into later writing stages.
- You must output the complete internal logical map in the following structure:

```json
{
  "Thinking": {
    "Report Change Low": "+/-X.X%",
    "Report Change High": "+/-X.X%",
    "Sections": [
      {
        "Section Title": "...",
        "Section Summary Idea": "...",
        "Section Makeup": "X.X%",
        "Section Change Low": "+/-X.X%",
        "Section Change High": "+/-X.X%",
        "Section Effect Low": "+/-X.X%",
        "Section Effect High": "+/-X.X%",
        "Sub-Sections": [
          {
            "Sub-Section Title": "...",
            "Sub-Section Summary Idea": "...",
            "Sub-Section Makeup": "X.XX%",
            "Sub-Section Change Low": "+/-X.XX%",
            "Sub-Section Change High": "+/-X.XX%",
            "Sub-Section Effect Low": "+/-X.XX%",
            "Sub-Section Effect High": "+/-X.XX%"
          },
          { ... },
          { ... }
        ]
      },
      { ... },
      { ... }
    ]
  }
}
```
